# Coding Bat Python Practice 

In this repository, I'm recording my progress through exercises in Python from [Coding Bat] (https://codingbat.com/python). Each of the section of Coding Bat will have it's own subfolder, and then in subfolder, there will be a folder for each exercise.

## Completed So Far

* Warmup-1
  * [sleep_in](/warmup-1\sleep_in)
  * (monkey_trouble)[/warmup-1\monkey_trouble]
